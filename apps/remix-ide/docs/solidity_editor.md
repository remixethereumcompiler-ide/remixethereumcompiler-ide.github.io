Solidity Editor
===============

The Remix editor recompiles the code each time the current file is
changed or another file is selected. It also provides syntax
highlighting mapped to solidity keywords.

Here's the list of some important features:

-   It display opened files as tabs.
-   Compilation Warning and Error are displayed in the gutter
-   Remix saves the current file continuously (5s after the last
    changes)
-   +/- on the top left corner enable you to increase/decrease the font
    size of the editor
