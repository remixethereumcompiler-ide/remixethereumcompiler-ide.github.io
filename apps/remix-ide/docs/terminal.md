Features, available in the terminal:

-   It integrates a JavaScript interpreter and the `web3` object. It
    enables the execution of the JavaScript script which interacts with
    the current context. (note that `web3` is only available if the
    `web provider` or `injected provider` mode is selected).
-   It displays important actions made while interacting with the Remix
    IDE (i.e. sending a new transaction).

    can choose to display all transactions or only transactions that

    the Remix IDE).
-   It allows searching for the data and clearing the logs from the
    terminal.
